ChaiTea Brewer  
===================  
This module is used to kickstart projects based on ChaiTea-Framework

## Install

	$ npm install -g chaitea-brewer

## Usage

	$ chaitea-brewer [name-of-my-app]

It will create a new app scaffolding under name-of-my-app folder with npm ready

## Final steps
You'll need to finish the npm modules installation by yourself with

	$ cd name-of-my-app
	$ npm install
	
## Devs
Start your app with ```npm test```. It will call a nodemon for the app, and watch only for changes on core files, not every coffeescript file.  

## Configuration and dettails
Refer to ChaiTea-Framework Documentation for this :D
